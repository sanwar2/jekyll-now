title: Second Week (June 11-17) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week I started working on the first project and watching parts of the Fifa World Cup. Late last night I finally got the last HckerRank test to pass but I still have a lot left before submitting it. I also tried a peanut butter hot chocolate drink and read about a strange "sport" called extreme ironing.

# What's in your way?
I feel like time and my own limitations are in my way. Everything takes longer than I expect and I feel like I'm not managing my time well. I keep freaking out, second guessing myself, and eventually changing all my answers to the wrong ones during the quizzes, so preparing for them doesn't seem to be helping. I'm also still not accustomed to being awake so early. During class I have headaches and after class, I pretty much pass out on the bus and at home once I get there. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I'm hoping to put the finishing touches on the first project and hopefully submit it early. I'm worried about the gigantic list of problems from pylint. I also hope to find a group to work with and start preparing for and working on the next project.

# What's your experience of the class? (this question will vary, week to week)
My experience with this class is mixed. I like the lectures and find them very informative without being boring. I wish we could have our devices out so I can record them. I have a terrible memory so having recordings as a reference would be helpful. I don't like studying for or taking the quizzes, however, I find going over them in class quite helpful.

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is to have a variety of ways to test your code. As strange as it sounds, sometimes unit and acceptance tests are not enough to test a program. My program for project one produced the right output but had some strange behavior in it such as unnecessarily computing values and then caching them. Some cleverly placed print statements quickly revealed this behavior. Additional acceptance tests may have caught the wrong values in the cache, but they wouldn't have caught the extra computations.
