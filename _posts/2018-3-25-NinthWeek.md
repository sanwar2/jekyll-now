title: Ninth Week (March 19-25) 
---
# What did you do this past week?
This past week I worked on the project and spent the first half of the week trying not to look as sick as I felt. I also got to try chicken feet and discover that eating too many in one sitting has the same effect as eating too much oatmeal. I also had a frightening experience while driving back home because someone was determined to suddenly change into my lane and stop in front of me while I was driving. Thankfully, I was able to hit the brakes and so was the driver behind me even though our light was and had been green for a while. 

# What's in your way?
I feel like everything is in my way. I find myself struggling with past insecurities and fears as well as the lack of time and energy. I've also caught myself waking up suddenly many times as if I'd had a nightmare. I don't remember anything, but I wonder if the reason I feel so tired may be related to the quality of sleep I'm getting.  

# What will you do next week?
Next week I am hoping to attend Mariam's talk. The schedule for the summer should also be posted, so I hope to start planning what classes I will be taking for my last few semesters. The week afterward there are a lot of deadlines, so I'll be trying to get a head start on them this week as well as studying. 

# What's my experience of the class?
My experience in this class is mixed. My quiz grades for this week have been a mixed bag for me but I also am really close to having enough points for an overall passing quiz grade. As usual, I feel like I understand what the professor is saying when he's explaining things, but then I am no longer sure when left to figure things out on my own.   

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week involves thinking about testing. I agree it is helpful when making sure your code does what you expect it to do, but I also don't think it is completely effective in making sure the program is completely faultless. It is easy to create tests for a program to pass, especially if the writer of the code is the same person writing the tests. This is why I think it is better for tests to be written by someone else who understands what the program does but didn't write it, similar to the HackerRank tests.
