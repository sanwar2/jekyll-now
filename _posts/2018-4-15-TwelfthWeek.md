title: Twelfth Week (April 9-15) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week I have started on the current project. I was able to eventually find a partner and we were able to get some of the classes working. Hopefully, we can get the cell class working, however, that one is proving to be trickier than the others. I was also able to get around to changing the pitcher filter so I finally can stop drinking bottled water at home. I have also spent a lot of time avoiding and being bitten by fire ants. There isn't any clear trail or group of them in my room, they just keep showing up. I've also discovered a very addicting flavor of Crystal Light. 

# What's in your way?
As usual, the lack of time is in my way. I also can't seem to focus, which just makes understanding or remembering something take even longer. I've also noticed that even though I feel like I understand something, I'm unable to remember or apply that information to something else, which is frustrating during assessments.  

# What will you do next week?
Next week I will be registering my classes for the next couple of semesters and also trying to finish up on the project. Once the project is over, I really need to start studying and practicing the material for the test. I also have other quizzes to study for because I haven't been as attentive during lectures as I should have been.  

# What's my experience of the class?
So far I'm feeling a bit lost in the class. When I first saw how many parts there were to the project, I felt overwhelmed because it seemed like there was more than usual involved. I also found the differences in method binding interesting. Coming from Java, I usually think in terms of dynamic binding, so I guess this is something that I might mess up within my c++ programs.  

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is related to something from this week's reading about dealing with bugs as soon as they are discovered. Especially with a project where all the classes are dependent on each other, it's important to continuously test the program while it's being written so those obvious problems are caught early. This also helps in understanding the flow of information through the program, so changes can be made more easily.
