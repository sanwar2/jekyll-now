title: First Week (January 15-21)

# What are your expectations of the class?

I'm not familiar with anything in this class, so I expect to spend a lot of time learning. I do not know C++. So, as a minimum, I expect to learn how to read and write programs in C++. I also hope to find out what object-oriented programming really is and why this class is called that. When using Java, I remember creating objects, however, I do not think this is what the class is about. Perhaps the required readings can help with that. Looking at the class website, I also expect to spend a lot of time learning many concepts in detail as well as how to use several different tools. None of this is familiar to me, so I expect to be spending a lot of time in front of a computer wondering why something is not working. 

# What did you do this past week?
I think this was the coldest first week of a semester I have ever had. There have been some changes to the bus schedules, so much of this week involved me walking around in the cold and then passing out from exhaustion after getting home. I also feel like I have been creating a lot of new accounts for my classes. I just recently got a small laptop to use during my classes, so this week I have been trying to get more comfortable carrying it around and getting used to the keyboard where the keys are much closer together.  
 
 # What's in your way?
 
The biggest thing in my way is probably myself and time. I am unfamiliar with a lot so I am worried that I will not be able to learn things in time for assignment deadlines or be helpful to group members if I eventually decide to work in a group. I am also not too thrilled with the interactive nature of this class. I get super anxious when asked to talk and my inexperience just adds to that insecurity and fear, making it more difficult for me to say anything. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I am hoping to start reading the first two chapters from the textbook and hopefully make notes so that studying for the tests and quizzes will be easier. I always say something like that and hopefully, this will be the semester I actually follow through with trying to prepare for tests early. I also hope to start practicing using git and completing the first assignments for my classes. 

# What's my experience of the class?
Unlike some other classes, the lectures are informative without being boring. I was actually able to stay awake during them. I also felt like the comparisons between java and c++ we went through with the classic "hello world" program helped me learn more about both languages because I do not recall other instructors walking through and explaining the program, or any other language, in such detail. For one goofy moment, I thought we would have to prove something about the Collatz Conjecture because it was starting to look like a math problem. Thankfully not, since this is not a class for writing proofs and also no one has yet been able to prove why it converges.   

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

It looks like this was not the first time I was asked to make a blog on Github. I had to relearn everything and the readme at this link as well as this second link were also helpful this time when I started editing the files for this blog.
