# What did you like the least about the class?
While taking tests on HackerRank was interesting, I think the tests were the thing I liked least about this class. I felt like I wasn't given enough time and also that I never understood how to prepare for them. My page of notes was not particularly helpful and redoing the HackerRank questions didn't help me because during the tests the stress made it difficult for me to focus or remember anything.

# What did you like the most about the class?
I can't believe I'm saying this but, I think the lectures were the thing I liked most about this class. They were interesting and it was nice to see that not everyone knew all the answers and that it was okay to be wrong. I actually learned more when someone got something wrong because it usually lead to a better explanation of what and why the right answer was what it was.

# What's the most significant thing you learned?
I learned a lot about the details of c++ and finally have a better understanding of pointers and the benefit of taking something by reference. Before this class, the small amount of c++ I wrote I treated like Java and pointers and references were just weird looking things  I avoided using. This class has also made it easier for me to understand the c++ documentation. So, I think the most significant thing I learned was to not treat this language like another because it has many similarities. 

# How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?
The time I spent coding per week varied from week to week. Maybe the average was around 10-15 hours per week. Near the beginning of the semester, the number was higher and closer to 20 or 30. The time decreased as the semester progressed because I started working with a partner and understood the code I was working with better.

# How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?
I think I spent an average of five hours a week reading for this class. I'm thinking this because I usually had time to study for an hour before class and an hour or two during the weekend.

# How many lines of code do you think you wrote?
After a quick glance at the projects and some code I wrote for practice, I think it's safe to say I wrote around 1000 lines, maybe slightly more. I definitely wrote more lines than I submitted because things rarely worked the first time I wrote them or I figured out a more condensed form to write some repetitive code. 

# What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
I think clang-format might be a tool I have never used and found useful. I tend to get messy with spaces and brackets while writing or experimenting with code, so this was a nice way to quickly remove the extra spacing and odd formatting. I might actually use this in the future when I find myself writing long and messy code. 

# If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
I would like to change something about the tests. Compared to the quizzes or lectures, I felt like neither studying nor taking the test help me understand the material or my grades. In many other classes studying for a test helped me understand the material better, but that wasn't true for this class because of the quality of the lectures. I'd probably find it more helpful to get more time for projects or have additional projects. An activity like the tests could still exist, however for a lower percentage of the overall grade or with more time.
