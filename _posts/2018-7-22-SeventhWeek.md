title: Seventh Week (July 16-22) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week I spent a lot of time doing a lot of research to figure out how to get parts of the project to work. The third phase ended up being more difficult than we anticipated and I felt quite unhelpful because most of what I tried didn't work. My other group members had a bit more luck than me. I also managed to get to class on time every day even though I did horribly on some quizzes, which is an improvement. 

# What's in your way?
The lack of time and experience is in my way. I'm also finding it difficult to stay motivated to keep trying when everything I attempt ends up not working. This whole week felt overwhelming and I feel like there's a lot that happened in class as well as with the projects. I'm finding it difficult to also choose what to focus on because the semester is close to ending. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I will try to familiarize myself with D3 and putting the finishing touches on the project. I'm really stressed out about the presentations because I tend to not do well in front of people. I also need to start studying for the test and working on the extra credit blog so that I'm not trying to do both these things on the same weekend. I heat is supposed to be crazy on Monday, so I'm hoping to get home early to avoid being out in that horrible weather. I can't wait until the weather is less extreme.  I'm also hoping to close some of these excessive number of tabs and browser I have open on my computers which were to help me with this class.  

# What was your experience relational algebra and SQL? (this question will vary, week to week)
I've had a little experience with SQL before, however, the way the questions were phrased on hackRank confused me. I wasn't a fan of relational algebra because I had trouble keeping the different types of joins straight in my head. I never thought of select and project as two different things, so how SQL is explained in the class was it different and confusing because it went into lower-level details I never considered before. 

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? 
I started looking into D3 and found this video as well as the attached code really helpful and informative for starting out. I usually find videos easier to understand and like how it's short and is somewhat related to something we were hoping to do when we first started this project at the beginning of the semester.
