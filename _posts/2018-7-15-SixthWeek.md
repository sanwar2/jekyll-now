title: Sixth Week (July 9-15) 
---


# What did you do this past week?
This past week I worked on another phase of the project and doing other things around the house. I also saw parts of the Fifa World cup throughout the week. I spent way too much time in front of my computer trying different things but having no success. This trend of feeling unproductive or helpful is starting to get really tiring.

# What's in your way?
The lack of time and experience is always in my way, however, this week I've also been starting to experience some of my other problems which have made school difficult including unreasonable amounts of stress, exhaustion, unexpected mood swings, and a ridiculous amount of bad luck. I've been having some pain and pressure in my chest lately, so I think my panic attacks are back. My mom has also been feeling worse than usual so I've been trying to help her without making her feel worse.  

# What will you do next week?
Next week I'll try to continue working on the next phase and starting on the extra credit assignment so that I'm not trying to finish the whole thing on the last week of class. I'm also hoping to go and get some groceries done because  I've neglected that last week. 

# What was your experience of Project #3 (setting up two Docker environments, consuming your own API, implementing your customer's user stories, providing user stories to your developers) (this question will vary, week to week)
I wouldn't call my experience of project 3 positive. It feels like we weren't able to complete it and I'm not entirely confident in what we turned in. Even with the extra day, we worked till the last minutes trying to get things working. For a while, we couldn't get the two Docker environments and the API to work together, so it looked like we wouldn't have a functioning website. We spend more time getting things set up and working than we did on the user stories which seemed a bit backwards to me. 

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip is to not be afraid to ask for help if you are having trouble figuring something out. While trying to convince everyone that it's okay to ask questions by telling us a personal story, one of my old professors once told the class, "There's always someone smarter than you." So I find it both understandable and funny that people don't ask for help or admit they are having trouble because they are scared of looking stupid. As a student, sometimes there are questions that professors think are inappropriate to ask in public, however, these can also be directed directly to the professor.
