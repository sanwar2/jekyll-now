title: Seventh Week (February 26- March 4) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week I went to the Atlassian talk and took a few tests and quizzes. It seemed like a mostly unlucky week because it seemed like anything that could go wrong during the day, happened. I finally felt brave enough to have fresh catfish for the first time in years. Cooking the fish the day it was purchased seemed to have really helped with the gross taste fish usually has. I also had microwave popcorn for the first time in years. I've been in the mood for watching vampire movies the last couple days, so I've been spending too much time looking for movies on Amazon and Hulu to distract myself. 

# What's in your way?
My anxiety is definitely getting in the way. It's so bad that I can't make decisions about what to do which is just making it harder to do things in a timely manner. I seem to also have trouble understanding what I'm reading because my brain is playing tricks on me. It took me a while to realize that "horror" and "California" were actually "honor" and "clarification." After a while, this stops being entertaining. The constant tightness in my chest and throat are also a bit irritating. 

# What will you do next week?
I haven't put much thought into next week. There are a lot of assignments and projects due next week, so that's a start. I'm also curious about dragon fruit and may spend some time finding good ways to eat it and eventually purchase some.

# What's my experience of the class?
My experience in this class is a bit mixed right now. I honestly don't think I have ever put so much daily effort into a class and yet have so many low grades. The attendance quizzes really helped increase my quiz grades this week and I'm anxious to find out how I did on the test. 

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
One of the speakers from Atlassian mentioned the importance of experimenting, even with the possibility of failure. This is pretty much my programming style where I try many things until something works. However, they weren't only talking about programming. They were also talking about the company and finding something that works for them. This idea can also be applied to an individual about how they can try different things until they are successful. On an unrelated note, if you snore, please close the door while you're sleeping. It's really distracting to those in another room if they're trying to get some work done.
