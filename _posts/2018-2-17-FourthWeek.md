title: Fourth Week (February 12-18) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week I haven't been feeling well. By now, it seems like that will be the norm for the semester. My brother left, I turned in some work that could have been better,  and I've been confined to bed for the last twelve hours after experiencing some severe pain and cold. Last night I took my mom to this new international supermarket which just opened this week. It was so busy, it was like black Friday.  She refused to leave without getting some buffalo fish. 

# What's in your way?
It seems like there is a conflict between what I want and how I am feeling. My brain isn't working as quickly as I would like and that is making it more difficult to have enough time to complete things. My anxiety is also getting the best of me and making it difficult to concentrate or do things correctly. Maybe something else is going on because I seem to be making more spelling mistakes than usual while writing this. I also seem to be having more trouble than usual getting to the minimum of 350 words.

# What will you do next week?
Next week there's a career fair I might go to. However, I've always found some excuse in the past for not going, so that might not happen. I also have a project and a few other assignments due in a different class. I might be spending more time on campus, so hopefully, I will discover a new, healthier place to eat. I am also hoping to get some practice in to start preparing for the first test in this class. 

# What's my experience of the class?
I still feel like this is a fast-paced class. Some of my quiz grades for this class have somewhat improved, but I don't expect that to continue. 

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
This post on professor Downing's website under tweets by utCompSci caught my eye because it was something that I felt was relevant to me and I finally got around to reading it. I spent my whole life being brought up on the idea that good things will happen if I have good grades and the opposite will happen if my grades are bad. It almost sounds like a religion. Also, Hackerrank has some c++ exercises which might be worth a try to get used to HackerRank and c++.
