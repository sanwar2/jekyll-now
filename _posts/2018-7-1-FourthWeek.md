title: Fourth Week (June 25- July 1) 
---


# What did you do this past week?
This past week I worked on the second project and started studying for the first test. I also needed to be a bit cleaver with when and where I did things because both the air conditioning and internet were sometimes not working. 

# What's in your way?
Other than having some bad luck with technology, I also feel like the lack of time and my own mental condition are in my way. I'm finding it difficult to remember anything while I am stressed, and the upcoming deadlines are quite successful at freaking me out. I also feel like one page isn't enough to help me with the test. On the other hand, I doubt I'll have time to look at it anyway. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I will actually take the first test and start on the third project. I'm so unfamiliar with everything that I don't understand what I'm supposed to do. Hopefully, this week I can prepare and understand what is needed so I can in some way contribute to the project. I also hope to continue watching the World Cup. It's quite unpredictable this year. 

# What was your experience of Project #1 (the problem, the overkill requirements of submission, and the grading) (this question will vary, week to week)
I found project 1 to be interesting. I've done this problem in c++ for another class, so I was surprised that I needed to optimize and change my approach for this project. Perhaps I'm crazy, but Python seems much slower. The pylint errors also caught me by surprise because I thought my code looked fine, but I ended up getting negative ratings. I'm happy with my grade and feel like it helped me practice writing in Python and get used to indenting things properly. I thought the directions on submitting the project were a bit odd and confusing because updating the README would change the git SHA and we weren't told what type of access to give the graders. I really like GitLab CI compared to Travis CI. It was much faster. 

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
To test simple statements, I find it easier to use an online compiler than to open up docker or some IDE because I normally have a browser open. Normally I do this to test my syntax or experiment with parts of the code posted on the schedule.
