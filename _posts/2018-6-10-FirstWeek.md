title: First Week (June 4-10) 
---


# What did you do this past week?
This past week I finally went to the optometrist for the first time in two years to get my prescription updated. I have been cursed with really bad eyesight my whole life so I was worried that my eyesight had worsened during that time. Luckily, it seems that I only needed a slight adjustment to the axis for one of my eyes. I also attended the first lecture of the class and later that day ate some Chinese food at the food court in a local Asian supermarket. I am hoping to visit there more often to sample more of the food. 

# What's in your way?
I feel like the lack of time and experience will be in my way when it comes to this class because I will be learning things for the first time during this shorter summer term. I also expect my anxiety and energy levels to get in the way.  I am quite worried about my ability to pass this class as well as waking up early to attend it because I have been having trouble sleeping for the last couple weeks. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I hope to attend the class lectures for the whole week as well as get started on the first project. I am also hoping to start trying to find a group to work with for the rest of the semester. 

# What are your expectations of the class? (this question will vary, week to week)
I expect to be kept very busy trying to learn things for the projects. I also do not expect to be able to get through all the readings for the week. Even after reading all of it, I do not expect to be able to remember everything so I am not expecting high quiz grades.  I am also excited to finally learn Python and Javascript this semester and expect to learn their benefits and differences compared to languages I already know. Regardless of what grade I make, I expect to learn a lot and am hopeful that this class will be a positive experience. 

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip is to check simple things you think are right. For example, last semester I spent a lot of time unsuccessfully trying o figure out why my picture on this blog was small even after editing the size in the style file. On a whim, I decided to look at the picture at the URL I was using and discovered that I needed to change the URL. Solving the problem was great, however, it could have been solved quicker or avoided if I had been careful earlier.
