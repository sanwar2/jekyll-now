What did you do this past week?

Last week the class only met once. We got our first introduction to the class in this one lecture. We went through the information on the syllabus and the class website. We also learned about the collatz conjecture for the first project. The main purpose of this project is to set up become familiar with some of the tools in this class.    
 
 What's in your way?
The biggest thing in my way is probably myself and time. There's nothing in this class I am familiar with so there's a lot for me to learn. When faced with the huge lists of links and requirements that are scattered all over schedule, I admit to feeling very panicked about my ability to understand everything my their deadlines. At the end of the day, all I can hope for is knowing more than when it began.  

What will you do next week?
By next week I really hope that I am in the final stages of completing the first project. Right now I am just learning how to use Github and will start with python soon, so there is a lot for me to learn. It is certainly looking like I will be busy learning the basics for this class. There are also assigned readings from a couple textbooks which I need to complete before class. Hopefully, I can read and make good enough notes of these readings to help me for the next test.    

Personal Reactions:
As usual, the first day was full of new information which is difficult to digest the first time I saw it. The good news is that the collatz conjecture was very interesting and easy to understand because of all the examples during the lecture. I do not have any past experience with python, Github, or anything else used in this course, so it will be interesting to see how much I can grasp and accomplish in the next few months. For the moment, the class website looks more intiminating than the lectures. It is similar to how I first felt when I started setting up this blog. When I first saw the canvas post for this blog and what is required, I did not know where to start. But once I started looking through the links and messing up a few times, I finally understood and came up with this. It does not look nice now, but with each week, I am hoping to learn how to edit and customize this page better. I remember a math related quote from when I was younger which applies to the situation, " the best angle is a triangle." It is a bit silly, but it is true that nothing gets done if it never gets started, even if it is wrong at first. As a starting point, the readme at this link was the most helpful when it came to starting this blog: https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/.
