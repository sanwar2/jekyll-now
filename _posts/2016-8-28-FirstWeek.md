What did you do this past week?

Last week the class only met once. We got our first introduction to the class in this one lecture. We went through the information on the syllabus and the class website. We also learned about the collatz conjecture for the first project. The main purpose of this project is to set up become familiar with some of the tools in this class.    
 

2. What's in your way?
The biggest thing in my way is probably myself. There's nothing in this class I am familiar with so there's a lot for me to learn. When faced with the huge lists of links and requirements that are scattered all over schedule, I admit to feeling very panicked about the future of my grades. At the end of the day, all I can hope for is knowing more than when it began.  


3. What will you do next week?
By next week I really hope that I am in the final stages of completing the first project. Right now I am just learning how to use Github, so hopefully my then I am more comforable with it. 

4. As usual, the first day is full of new information which is difficult to digest the first time I saw it. The happy news is that the collatz conjecture was very interesting and easy to understand because of all the examples during the lecture. I don't have any past experience with python, Github, or anything else used in this course, so it will be interesting to see how much I can grasp and accomplish in the next few months. For the moment, the website looks more intiminating than the lectures. It's similar to how I first felt when I started writing this blog. When I first saw the canvas post for this blog and what is required, I didn't know where to start. But once I started looking through the links and messing up a few times, I finally understood and came up with this. I remember a math related quote from when I was younger which applied to the situation, " the best angle is a triangle."
