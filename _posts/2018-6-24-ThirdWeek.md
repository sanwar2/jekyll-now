title: Third Week (June 18-24) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week I missed the bus every day so I arrived on campus later than I wanted. I was also stressed out from trying to figure out the pylint and coverage complaints so I ended up drinking more soda and sleeping more than usual. I also met my group for the next project. Coming up with a suitable topic ending up taking longer than I expected. 

# What's in your way?
I think time, experience, and anxiety will be in my way. Nowadays I tend to shut down when I feel stressed out, which isn't really helpful because I also get stressed and tired much quicker than most people. I hope I will be helpful to my group. I will try to learn the material, but at least if I can't do anything else, at least I hope to bring some inspiration or some type of motivational aid to my group members. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I hope to complete project 2 and perhaps install docker onto the computer I normally take to campus. I'm also having trouble typing right now, so I think it's time to trim these nails down soon. 

# What did you think of the talk by Miriam, Nalini, and Shan? (this question will vary, week to week)

I thought the talk was interesting. I'd would say the strangest thing about them is that they all seem successful but it didn't seem like they really planned most of it early in their life. It seems like everyone around me expects me to have some plan or goal for the future and if I don't, I'm seen as a someone without a good future. I think the most helpful advice for me would be not being afraid to fail and also the idea of finding what fits me the most. I have heard this already, but it's great to hear different people say this because sometimes it's difficult to believe. 

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
When trying to increase the coverage for my code, I found the command "coverage html" helpful because it was slightly more informative about why certain lines were skipped. I was able to see my code as well as highlighted lines for what was missed, which made it easier to think of test cases which would actually use those lines.
