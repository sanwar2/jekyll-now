title: Fourth Week (February 4 - 11) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week I've been really tired. I got some more cleaning done around the house compared to last week. At the moment, I don't remember accomplishing much of anything other than that. I managed to get to my classes and turn in my homework, but I don't remember having the energy to stay up extra hours and work on the project. I had very little sleep for the first project and got an awesome grade, so hopefully, I won't regret taking it easy this time. I saw parts of the Superbowl and Olympics and spent some time trying to understand the makefile from the previous project. I also had a bit of a scare after picking up my mom from work yesterday because she was feeling so awful that she thought she needed to go to the hospital. It worries me that she panics every time she starts feeling unwell, which just makes her feel worse. It makes it tougher to decide if she needs to go to the hospital or just rest for a while.  

# What's in your way?
I worry about time because there's less than one week left for the project. For now, my availability is short and uncertain, which would be unfair to anyone I partner with, so I decided to work on the current project alone. I feel like this puts me at a disadvantage because two people would probably figure out the project faster than one. The lack of motivation is also making it difficult to get through this one.  

# What will you do next week?
Next week I'm hoping to finish the second project. I might also consider looking over my resume to prepare for the upcoming career fair. There's a test at the end of the month, so I would also like to practice some of the quiz and HackerRank questions.  

# What's my experience of the class?
At the moment, I feel like this class is going really fast and I don't know what I don't really know. I can tell that pointers and addresses really confuse me, but during lectures, I feel like I am able to understand what is happening because the explanations are clear. Maybe I need more practice to help explore and understand the concepts better. I don't know what was more odd, a pointer pointing to nowhere, or hearing a story about paint guns to explain the different cases of using const.  

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I don't know about anyone else, but I found it helpful to write and print values one line at a time instead of trying to write all the code at once and then trying to figure out the logic and where it's going wrong. Printing out the values to the structures I created helped me see when values weren't what I expected because I didn't initialize them correctly.
