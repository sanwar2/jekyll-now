title: Third Week (January 29-February 4) 
---


#What did you do this past week?
This week was the first week of this semester where I got very little sleep working on the project and studying for quizzes. I honestly didn't think I would be able to submit it on time and I'm still not sure I submitted it correctly. My grades seem to be falling in this class as I'm doing worse on the quizzes. I also finally got a flu shot and I ate a lot of junk food and sugary, caffeinated drinks. One day I had the equivalent of three cans of soda. My mom also received her shot on a different arm than usual and was in pain for about 12 hours. After surviving a stroke last year, she found it ridiculous that she didn't like the pain from her shot and I thought it was funny how scared she was of dying from the shot since getting our shots was her idea. She survived.   

#What's in your way?
I feel like I'm having trouble remembering and focusing on things. When taking the quizzes, I've been losing my train of thought, and then randomly picking an answer when I notice I'm running out of time. I seem to be having trouble with the time limits. Maybe I should try using scratch paper and find some more practice material for c++.  

#What will you do next week?
Hopefully the next project will be posted soon so I can get started on it next week. I am also hoping to use next week to catch up on my other homework and housework I've been neglecting this week.  

#What's my experience of the class?
At the moment I'm finding this class tricky. Reading and memorization might be a little helpful for the quizzes, but a deeper understanding is required to do well on the projects, quizzes, and activities. I honestly felt overwhelmed by this first project, but hopefully, the stuff on the workflow won't be as difficult to do next time. 

#What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Since I'm more comfortable in Java, creating mini java programs to check the c++ output from the custom input on HackerRank really helped. Also, cloning the code while logging in remotely into the cs machines made it easier to use the formatting and documentation tools since they were already installed.
