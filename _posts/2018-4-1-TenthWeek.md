title: Tenth Week (March 26- April 1) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week I went to Miriam's talk and started working on the current project. After asking about a project's requirements for another class, I was horrified to find out we weren't as complete with the project as we thought we were. I also saw a Russian movie about dragons. I'm used to using subtitles, so I didn't mind that it was in another language. 

# What's in your way?
Time and my personal condition are in my way. It feels like all the professors decided that this would be a good week for everything to be due. I also seem to be very tired this week. I've been napping a lot everywhere at the most inconvenient of times. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I hope to get everything related to registration done. The schedules should be posted so I hope to have those semesters planned out. So far I've been disappointed with what's offered during the summer. 

# What's my experience of the class?
My experience in this class is a bit unknown. A few hours ago I got my results for the last project, so I think I should be able to pass this class. I'm still unsure about how the grade for the blog is determined. Sometimes questions like that tend to annoy professors and their unhelpful response is, "It's in the syllabus!" Professor Downing does seem to be a lot more patient than other professors and he doesn't seem to mind when students don't know the answers when he calls on them. I've been too tired this week to be really engaged an focused on the class material, which I'm sure I'll be regretting soon. 

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week involves creating the makefile. For the last two projects, it seems like this file gives people trouble. In my experience, most of the problems are because of formatting such as spaces instead of tabs or forgetting to change something when copying an old one. It's a good idea to have a program do a search for phrases that were relevant only to the other project so that you are sure they are not there.
