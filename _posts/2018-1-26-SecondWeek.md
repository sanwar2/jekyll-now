title: Second Week (January 22-28) 
---


# What did you do this past week?
This was the first full week of class. I spent the week trying to get used to the new schedule rather than just lounging around all day.  Looks like the waitlist system also ended and I was unable to get into any additional classes. I started the first project for this class but have not gotten as far as I wanted to because I was having trouble getting the original code to compile. I also just finished checking over the submission for the first assignment in a different class. 

# What's in your way?
I have been having a lot of trouble concentrating and motivating myself to be in class because my allergies have been worse than ever. Usually, if I ever get them, they only last for a couple days. However, this year they do not seem to go away until today. Hopefully, they will not come back again.  The non-drowsy medicine drains me of the little energy I have and it was unfortunately not fully effective against the symptoms.   

# What will you do next week?
Next week I am hoping to get better doing the readings. The textbook is too large to be carrying around, so I will have to take notes or pictures and study them. I also hope to finish the first project for this class. 

# What's my experience of the class?
I like how informative the lectures are. I have been to many classes where I have zoned out during lectures because I was tired or they were too difficult to follow. The lectures for this class are easy to follow and are not overwhelming even though I feel like a lot of information is given during the time. Even the quizzes end up being a learning experience because when we go over them, I get a chance to think about the problem and learn something new. Unfortunately, I wish I was not initially guessing on some of those questions.  For now, it feels like the quizzes are either testing me on how well I am at guessing or memorization. 

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I spent a very long time trying to get the project to compile on Travis. I think my tip is to make sure things are copied correctly. In my case, some of the file names were slightly altered and the content in the files was also not copied correctly. I spent a lot of time trying to fix something that should have already worked. I should have been more careful and patiently added and checked one file at a time to make sure it was correct.
