title: Fifth Week (July 2- 8)
---

# What did you do this past week?
This week enjoyed a break by taking the first test and not returning to campus until the weekend. I also spent a lot of time trying to familiarize myself with the topics for the next phase. On Wednesday I went out to see a local fireworks display, but unfortunately got distracted trying to find shelter from the rain. Throughout the week, I also managed to get some cleaning done. It's funny how much better I feel being in places after they are finally clean. 

# What's in your way?
I feel like time and the lack of experience are in my way. I seem to spend a lot of time trying things and getting little results for my efforts. I'm also unsure what is acceptable or expected in this class because we don't spend a lot of time discussing the projects during class. 

# What will you do next week?
I am hoping to complete the current phase and begin the next phase of the project since there are very related. I also hope to get better at practicing the code we learn next week to help prepare for the next test. 

# What was your experience of Test #1 (the multiple-choice questions, the coding problems, and the use of HackerRank) (this question will vary, week to week)
I thought the test was difficult because it was over two languages and the readings. I didn't expect to be tested over the readings so I didn't keep good notes. So, I felt unprepared for that part. I also felt annoyed that I couldn't remember the right syntax for the javascript methods. Considering how different they were from python, I should have written this on the sheet of notes. I liked using HackerRank because I am able to test my code. I wish there was also a way to see if I was not violating a constraint because it's really easy to get caught up in passing the tests rather than read and remember the text at the top of the page. I'm glad there was an opportunity to retake the test, however, I think the timing could have been improved if the date was after we knew our actual grades and how much we missed. 

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Sometimes it helps to know and understand the default behavior of things. My group spent a couple days trying to figure out why only one person had access to everything. I also recall spending a couple of days wondering why the temperature setting on my new thermostat kept changing. Sadly, the manual wasn't very helpful on how to change this and I quickly figured it out within minutes by pressing random buttons. I wish everything was that quick and easy to figure out.
