title: Eleventh Week (April 2-8) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week has been very stressful with many projects, quizzes, and assignments due. Unfortunately, stress no longer works as a motivator for me so almost everything I turned in was not as good as it could have been. My taste in movies this week also reflects my fluctuating mood and weather as I saw a violent adult movie one day and a humorous kids movie the next.

# What's in your way?
As usual, time is in my way as well as a lack of motivation. With only a month left in the semester, I seem to have given up earlier than usual. Experiencing difficulty while doing the assignment also doesn't help me stay motivated to complete it because it just makes me more discouraged and anxious. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I have more quizzes to study for and it will be a good idea to try to start the next project early. Hopefully, I can find a partner, however, this increasing laziness and lack of motivation are making me wonder if I would end up being unfair to my partner if I'm not helpful or give up. I'm also hoping to finally go to the grocery store so that there can be a larger variety of food in the house.  

# What's my experience of the class?
As the end of the semester is getting closer, I am starting to get more and more worried about my grades and the last test. This past week I saw a slight improvement in my quiz grades but that was the only good news. 

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I was reading an article about stress after seeing something on television about people being prone to forget to do things when they are stressed. I certainly feel like my brain doesn't work properly when I am stressed so I wonder why work or school need to be so stressful. Like everything, I believe that everyone can have different reactions to the same situation, so I can't really think of a solution which would work for everyone or every situation. I can agree with the article that the most important thing is to understand yourself and do what works for you. https://www.oakbendmedcenter.org/better-ways-to-cope-with-stress-in-2018/
