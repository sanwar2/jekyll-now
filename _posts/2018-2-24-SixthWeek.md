title: Sixth Week (February 19-25)

# What did you do this past week?
Today is the first day this week I have used this laptop, it almost feels like I've been reunited with an old friend since this is the one I usually use. This past week I feel like I have been doing a lot of waiting. I have been waiting for my grades on assignments to see how badly I did and have also been waiting for the bus more often. I had a group project due this week so I was on campus much later, late enough to find out that the GDC doors are locked much earlier than I expected. The cold and wet weather this week made the walks and waits for the bus unpleasant and somewhat creepy because there were not that many people around. I also finally saw the movie Despicable Me 3 and saw part of a curling game.  

# What's in your way?
As usual, the lack of time, energy, and mental capability seems to make the week difficult. I seem to be able to focus on one class at a time so when I have stuff in one class, everything else seems to suffer. The state of my house seems to confirm this as well. I also feel like I am no longer understanding explanations that are given to me during class. I also feel like I am not getting enough time to understand coding problems because it takes me a while to understand what is happening. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I am hoping to attend the Atlassian talk on Monday. It is after one of my classes, so hopefully, I will be able to arrive on time and be awake enough to pay attention. I also have a lot to memorize for the upcoming test and quizzes in this and another class. I am not sure how I will be able to remember all the material or get comfortable enough to do a coding test in less than two hours. I am usually not creative enough to come up with solutions that quickly. 

# What's my experience of the class?
At the moment this class feels overwhelming. We are starting to learn things in c++ which I am having trouble following. I am also unsure of how to prepare for the test and create the sheet we are allowed to have to aid us. I was hoping to have coding examples to help remember the syntax of statements, but recently I saw a post saying that the sheet can not have any code. 

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
There is a lot of reading in this class so I thought having it read to me by my browser would be helpful. The outcome was somewhat entertaining when it got to code. I doubt this feature will be helpful, I think I will just read the articles myself the old-fashioned way. Also, while doing the project in another class I found it helpful to keep track of what I needed to do and have done in a text file because there were many parts of it.
