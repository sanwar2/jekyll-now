title: Eighth Week (March 5-11) 
---

# What did you do this past week?
This past week I have had a crazy craving for chocolate. I've been eating a lot of chocolate and have even tried chocolate hummus. It isn't as gross as it sounds, but it isn't as sweet as Nutella. I've spent a lot of time on campus working on a group project for another class, so I've also been eating very unhealthy food. My favorite place to eat is Panda Express, however, I wouldn't recommend getting tea with tapioca if you don't like rubbery squishy things in your tea.

# What's in your way?
The lack of time always feels like it's in my way. Even when professors extend deadlines a couple days, it seems like that isn't enough time. I also feel like I'm not understanding what is required from me for certain assignments. The project descriptions or questions aren't as clear as I would like, especially the first time I read them. 

# What will you do next week?
Next week I'm finally having a week where I don't need to be on campus. Hopefully, that's a chance to eat a little better. I'm also hoping to start the project and catch up on some cleaning I've been neglecting. Unfortunately, I also have a dentist appointment coming up, which usually is an unpleasant experience. 

# What's my experience of the class?
This week feels a bit more relaxed in the class because there weren't any large assignments due. My quiz grades started out great, but they weren't so good on Friday. I still have trouble understanding c++ code the first time I see it. I was happy that I was able to find a partner for the upcoming project. Considering it took more than one class day to explain, I expect it to be more difficult than the previous ones. I always worry that I won't be helpful to the people I work with because of a difference in experience levels. I hope that doesn't happen in this class.    

# What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip would be not to give up on something difficult until there's a good reason to stop, like a deadline. When my group started our project earlier this week, we did not understand it at all. We met every day and even though a lot of the time we were confused and staring blankly at our screens, we still managed to turn something in. Similarly,  in this class, I've spent a lot of time trying to get HackerRank tests to pass and after a few days of trying, it would seem that I would never find a solution. I've learned a lot from these failures, but at the same time, I eventually did find a solution, which always feels like an awesome accomplishment too.
