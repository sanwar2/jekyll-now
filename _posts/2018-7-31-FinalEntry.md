# What did you like the least about the class?
The thing I liked least about this class is the amount of required reading. There's already a lot of material to understand from class, so adding a few really long articles and several chapters out of a book is very overwhelming. Especially since they're difficult to follow and the only place the material gets used in the class is maybe a few multiple choice questions. Given how much there is to learn for this class for the lecture material and the project, having required readings didn't make sense. 

# What did you like the most about the class?
One thing that this class uses and other programming classes did not is HackerRank. I really liked using HackerRank because it lets me test the code I'm writing so I know it works. It's annoying that there are very little opportunities for partial credit for tests, however since sometimes the questions on the tests have some similarities to the practice ones, I feel like the tests are somewhat manageable. I also liked how this semester we were able to retake tests for a 60 if we needed to. 

# What's the most significant thing you learned?
I would like to say the most significant thing I learned in this class is not related to the material taught in it. If that was it, then it wouldn't impact me at all after the class ended. I think the value of not giving up and getting along with team members who are struggling or seem to get less done is an important life skill. I think normally when working in groups there will always be a difference in skills, experience, and opinions, so it is important to learn how to positively interact with each other instead of insulting people because of their mistakes or shortcomings. In the long run, I think everyone will be happier and more productive that way.

#How many hours a week did you spend coding/debugging/testing for this class?
I think on average I spent about 15 hours a week coding, debugging, and testing. However, I think most of the code I wrote didn't work so, I'm not sure I should count it into this estimate. 

# How many hours a week did you spend reading/studying for this class?
On average I think I spent about four hours a week reading to study for the quizzes and perhaps an additional four hours reading for the projects. I probably also spent a couple more hours watching related videos as well. For some phases I think I read more, however, I doubt my times are typical because it usually takes me longer than others to understand what I am reading.

# How many lines of code do you think you wrote?
I think I wrote about 800 lines of code. I feel like most of the time I either copied and pasted most of the code I used or made minor changes to existing code so that is why I wrote so little. Most of the work I did for the projects did not involve writing a lot of code because my group usually tried to make it a goal to write as little code as possible so it's cleaner and easier for us to follow and debug.

# What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
I think Docker with AWS is a required tool which I did not know how to use which I will find useful. I've had an AWS account for a while, but didn't know it was possible to use Docker on an instance. Since I only have Windows computers, it was a bit tricky for me to get Docker installed on my computers, but once I did, I was able to use the material for all the languages in this class. Later in the semester, I learned how to use Docker with AWS. I think since things are different in Windows, using Docker with AWS in the future will be easier than trying to install everything locally onto my computer. Especially if it is Docker that is difficult to install.

# What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?
For me, the most helpful tool we used was MySQL Workbench. I had trouble getting MySQL to work from my terminal and eventually didn't update or change our database from there because the layout on MySQL Workbench was easier to see and understand. 

# If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
If I can change one thing about this class, it would be the quizzes. They are really easy to miss because they are at the beginning of class and there is also not a lot of time. I think going over the questions is a worthwhile experience because I sometimes learn the material from the previous lecture better through them. Perhaps change the grading so students don't get a zero for trying. For example, give partial credit for attempting a question or include an attendance question as one of the questions.
